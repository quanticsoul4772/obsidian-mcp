# Conversation-Aware Cache Implementation Summary

## Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented conversation-aware caching with minimal changes to the codebase.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. src/index.ts
- Added import for LRUCache
- Created two cache instances:
  - `fileCache`: 50MB for file content, 1-hour TTL
  - `searchCache`: 10MB for search results, 30-minute TTL
- Passed caches to FileUtils and SearchUtils constructors

#### 2. src/utils/file-utils.ts
- Added optional cache parameter to constructor
- Modified `readFile()` to:
  - Check cache first (using normalized path as key)
  - Cache content if under 5MB
- Added cache invalidation to:
  - `writeFile()` - deletes cached entry
  - `deleteFile()` - deletes cached entry
  - `renameFile()` - deletes old path from cache

#### 3. src/utils/search-utils.ts
- Added optional cache parameter to constructor
- Modified `searchText()` to:
  - Check cache using JSON stringified query/options as key
  - Cache the complete response
- Modified `advancedSearch()` similarly

### Total Lines Changed: ~35

### Benefits:
- Repeated file reads now return instantly from cache
- Search operations are cached for 30 minutes
- Automatic cache invalidation on file modifications
- Memory usage capped at 60MB total
- Zero configuration needed

### Next Step:
Restart the application to load the new cached server implementation.
